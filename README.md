# node-red-csv-parser
Simple Node-RED flow for uploading/deleting CSV files from dashboard and converting it to JSON objects.

# Requirements
Node-RED >= v3.0
  Palletes:
    - node-red-contrib-dashboard [LINK](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard)

# Description
<p>Simple flow for reading and saving files into preselected directory.
Files are read and content is displayed in a template node.</p>

<p>Dashboard gives an option to 'activate' detected datapoints, which means to save them into 'datapoints' object -
a global variable.</p>

<p>This parser has been used to read CSV files generated by WAGO EDM software to then read listed MODBUS registers.</p>

# Instructions
- Flow is preset to save files into './files' directory (directory is created if it doesn't exist)
- Flow is preset to accept '.csv' files only
- Template node is preset to display elements of detected objects:
    - ID
    - Name
    - Description
    - Unit
    - Datatype
    - Address
    - FC
  
 > <p>As mentioned, this parser has been used to read a list of MODBUS registers, but if intended use is different, simply just change column titles and element references inside template node.</p>
